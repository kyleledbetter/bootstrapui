Addition GUI for Bootstrap
===========

Addon to Bootstrap with flexbox layout and app GUI components

#TL;DR

- git clone https://github.com/kyleledbetter/bootstrapui.git 
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `grunt`

For now just navigate to the files in /docs/examples manually. We're not using a port or anything dynamic (yet)
