Addition GUI for Bootstrap
===========

Addon to Bootstrap with flexbox layout and app GUI components

#TL;DR

- git clone https://github.com/kyleledbetter/bootstrapui.git 
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `grunt`

For now just navigate to the files in /docs/examples manually. We're not using a port or anything dynamic (yet)

#app

Edit the files in the app directory:

- /styles - the LESS files
- /scripts - the JavaScript files
- /images - images, duh

#dist

Don't touch these, this is the distributed, compiled css/js and optimized images

#docs

Create example GUIs and docs here. If you don't want to distribute assets put them in /docs/assets
